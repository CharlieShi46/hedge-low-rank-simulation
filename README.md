## 🧠 Project Overview
This project studies how the Exponential Weights/Hedge algorithm behaves under
low-rank expert-loss matrices. Prior work required slow rejection sampling to
generate rank-r matrices. I implemented a faster constructive method that:

- generates exact low-rank binary loss matrices efficiently  
- enables large-scale simulation (1M+ runs)  
- allows empirical measurement of worst-case regret as rank varies  

The experiments confirm that Hedge **implicitly adapts to low-rank structure** and
exhibits the expected √r regret behavior.
